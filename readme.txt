GetItDone: Better Service Matching

Description
GetItDone is a matchmaking site, but not of the romantic variety. Instead, GetItDone matches up people who need services and people who provide those services. For example, one person may post an ad on the site advertising their dog-walking services in a particular neighbourhood. Another person posting on the site may be looking for a dog walker in the same neighbourhood. GetItDone will match those two people up using keywords that they have each provided. It differs from Craigslist and Kijiji in that one does not need to painstakingly browse through ads to find what he or she is looking for, though that option is still available. GetItDone does most of the work for you. Only people who fit the criteria you are looking for in a service provider will show up, much like matchmaking sites only display romantic matches within a certain age range, for example. GetItDone is an example of collaborative consumption, since it offers people a technological means to directly share resources (in this case the skills and knowledge of one another). As such, GetItDone is also an example of a sharing economy.

How It Works
On GetItDone, an individual (or a group) (who we refer to as the “consumer”) can find a service of interest from various service providers (who we refer to as the "provider"). A user can register on the system as both a provider and consumer. As a provider, the user gives details of the service they offer and themselves. As a consumer, the user can search for useful and interesting services, as well as post service requests describing the specifics of the service they want. Both providers and consumers supply keywords which the site uses to create tailored recommendations. Once the consumer finds a suitable provider, they indicate their interest by sending a notification to the provider. A mutual agreement, which can be amended by either party, is generated. When both consumer and provider agree to the terms of the service, the consumer makes a payment. Afterwards, the provider is notified and the service is rendered. After the transaction, each party provides feedback and a rating to each other. The consumer then becomes a "patron" of the provider. All of the patrons of a provider from the same post form a social network, which allows them to communicate with one another and share their experiences with that provider.

Challenges for GetItDone
The transaction system requires users to pay in advance. Due to the intangible nature of some services and the lack of a third party witness, this renders providers’ credibility crucial to purchase decisions. In addition, it is reasonable to doubt the validity of reviews. The providers themselves may boost their rating with fake reviews, while competitors may frame honest providers. To maintain GetItDone’s communal integrity, reputation systems are adopted. On top of the generic rating system with text-based review, images related to the service transaction can be attached for evidence. It is anticipated that this system can improve user satisfaction.


The Project
Our team is responsible for the design and development of a complete and functional web application for service transactions. Our system will support the following components:
User Authentication and Authorization: User authentication will be done through common means of username and password coupling, or via facebook.
User Profiling: Each registered user in the system has a profile containing their information. This information includes: user id, user rating, services purchased and/or performed, reviews, current requests and offerings.
User Interactions: Each user can take on the role of a provider and/or consumer. Providers may post services they offer or apply to consumer requests. Consumers can purchase offered services or post a request.
Social Network: Users are free to interact with others for various purposes. These interactions include subscribing to new offerings or requests, as well as reviewing each other after a transaction. All reviews are public. Users can contact the author of any review via email. Notifications and emails are sent regarding purchases, offers to posts,  and general updates.
Reputation System: Both the provider and the consumer are given the opportunity to review each after each transaction. A review consists of a rating (1 to 5 stars) and comments about the transaction.  A user’s average rating and most recent reviews are displayed on the user’s profile.
Search and Recommendation System: The search system helps users find the service offerings and requests they are interested in. Users are expected to provide keywords related to their search, then the system presents posts with matching keywords in its title or description. The results are sorted by relevancy, where matches with a higher number of matching keywords are displayed with higher priority. When a user creates a post and types in a keyword followed by the hash symbol, a side panel will appear and display relevant posts from other users. Alternatively, there is a recommendation system that customizes the main page after login. These include featured posts and posts that potentially matches user interests.
Administrative View: Our system supports an administrative view of the system. Administrative functionalities include changing passwords and profile informations, banning users, updating and deleting posts, as well as viewing basic statistics regarding website activity, like total number of mutual agreements accepted of the day.
Subscription System: Registered users are free to subscribe to other users. Updates will come through notifications or appear on the front page of the user’s profile.
